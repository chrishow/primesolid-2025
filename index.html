        The fog color and density can be adjusted in the shader code. The
        distance from the camera to the object is calculated in the fragment
        shader, and the fog effect is applied based on this distance.

        The fog effect is created by blending the color of the object with the
        color of the fog based on the distance from the camera. The fog density
        can be adjusted to create a more or less dense fog effect.

        distance from the camera.

        This is a simple fog effect using WebGL and GLSL. The fog is created by
        blending the color of the fog with the color of the object based on the
        distance from the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fog color and density can be adjusted in the shader code. The
        distance from the camera to the object is calculated in the fragment
        shader, and the fog effect is applied based on this distance.

        The fog effect is created by blending the color of the object with the

        can be adjusted to create a more or less dense fog effect.
